# RadioView Open-Source
## Thought I'd make my shitty code open-source if anyone needs examples or just wants to "borrow" it.

---

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/G3VV/RadioView.git
$ node main.js
```
### **Runs on port `3000`, so https://localhost:3000**
### Easy as that, apart from the installing node part fuck that shit
#### enjoy my shit ass code, sayonara
